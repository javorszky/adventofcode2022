# adventofcode2022

* [day 1](day1) - essentially array manipulation, reduce, sum
* [day 2](day2) - efficient map lookup and hardcoding the few possibilities
* [day 3](day3) - codepoints, maps, common values
* [day 4](day4) - ranges -> maps, merge, length checks
* [day 5](day5) - slice manipulation, FILO queue, push and pop implementation 
* [day 6](day6) - byte readers and limited readers and offsets and array uniqueness
* [day 7](day7) - recursive tree
* [day 8](day8) - it's just a lot of for loops. Like, a LOT
* [day 9](day9) - hm, coordinate system, links, lots of loops again, early exits
* [day 10](day10) - for loops, registers, strings.Builder, keeping track of values
* [day 11](day11) - channels, multi-tree, primes, normalization, and functional structs
